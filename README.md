### What I have done in this project ?

##### "Initial score Start from 0" - This suggests that when the project starts, the score or calculation begins at 0.
##### "On Increment and Decrement field you need to press Enter Key to add it with the Result" - This indicates that there are fields in the project that allow you to increase or decrease the score, and in order for these changes to be applied to the final result, you need to press the "Enter" key.
##### "If you add bigger value then Result it will never show any negative number" - This implies that the project has some sort of restriction where the score cannot go below 0, even if you add a larger value than the current score.
